# Duet-Maestro-Menu

A set of files to allow a Duet Maestro to present a basic menu system on a 12864 reprap graphic display.

Upload the files to your /menu folder. Beware, any existing files with the same name will be overwritten, so you might want to back them up first.

## Tools

I used my [RRF image generator](https://github.com/jameswood/RepRapFirmware-Image-Tools) to create the images I've added or changed.
